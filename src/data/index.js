Though all those elements were essential for our planet to sustain any life, it is said that an entity named Anjä was born in the depths of the Earth. She had the daunting task of containing the elements in an ancient relic and becoming its guardian. Century by century, nature finally calmed down. So Anjä slowly disappeared, conscientiously/carefully leaving the relic hidden inside a temple. But she hadn’t planned on humankind appearing… and stealing the relic for their own purposes.''",
